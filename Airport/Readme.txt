Simulation is technique used to study the performance of a physical system 
by using a physical, mathematical, or computer model of the system.
The use of simulation can help desiners estimate the expected performance of the system
before it is built, and lead to changes in the design 
that may improve the expected performance of the system.
This program that simulates the operation of an airport that has only two runways 
to handle all takeoffs and landings. Each takeoff or landing takes 15 minutes to complete.
One runway request is made during each five-minute time interval, and the 
likelihood of a landing request is the same as for a takeoff request. 
Priority is given to planes requesting a landing. 
If a request cannot be honored, it is added to a takeoff or landing queue.
This simulate 120 minutes of activity at the airport.
Each request is time-stamped and added to the appropriate queue. 
The output of programe include the final queue contents, the number of takeoffs completed,
the number of landings completed, and the average number of minutes spent in each queue.
